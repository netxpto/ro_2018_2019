Guidelines for implementation of a fiber model block:

- input parameters:
z
beta2
attenuation
pulse width


- the block has an internal instance of a FD_Filterb block, already available on the netxpto library, uses the transfer function of the fiber andconcolutes it with
the input signal outputting it to the
